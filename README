Description: Class game of bomberman with single player / multiplayer.

------------------------------------------------------

Instructions: To run the game, type the following command

python main.py

# Multiplayer
To run this, it is a bit more complicated. Currently it is set to run on the localhost. 
This setting can be modified from the config.py file. In order to run it on your server,
change LOCALHOST = True to LOCALHOST = False. server_tcp, admin, and game file is currently 
set to localhost / reflecting my online server. Those values would have to be changed as well. 

Assuming we are on localhost. You will need to run two separate instances of the game.

# Run the server
python ~/bomberman/server_tcp.py

# Start the two instances of the games, join multiplayer
python ~/bomberman/main.py
python ~/bomberman2/main.py

# Run the admin to start the multiplayer game
python ~/bomberman/admin.py

Press 8 to start the game
